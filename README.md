Welcome to the Generative AI Internship! This program is designed to provide hands-on
experience with cutting-edge generative AI technologies. Interns will work on real-world
projects, develop advanced machine learning models, and gain a deep understanding of
generative algorithms such as GANs, VAEs, and autoregressive models.
Throughout the internship, participants will have the opportunity to collaborate with experienced
AI researchers and industry professionals, enhancing both their technical skills and professional
network. Whether you're looking to start a career in AI or expand your existing knowledge, this
internship offers a comprehensive learning experience in the exciting field of generative AI.
We look forward to your contributions and are excited to see the innovative projects you'll
develop!

technical expertise in AI.
3. **Competitive Readiness:** Prepare students for competitive scenarios in the tech industry.
4. **Technological Understanding:** Foster a deep understanding of the latest technologies and
their applications.
5. **Git/GitHub Proficiency:** Teach students how to control their repository and work in
collaborations using Git/GitHub.
6. **Project Development Workflow:** Ensure students learn the complete workflow of
engineering project development and management.
## Rules and Regulations
1. **Eligibility:** Open to all first-year and second-year students of KIET Group of Institutions.
2. **Attendance:** Students must attend all scheduled sessions and complete all assigned
tasks.
3. **Assignments:** All assignments and projects must be submitted on time.
4. **Ethics:** Students must adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity and
professionalism.
5. **Collaboration:** While collaboration is encouraged, all work submitted must be original and
completed by the individual.
## Sample Projects
During this internship, you can work on the following projects or can have an idea to develop the projects which can be derived from this:

1. **Basic GAN Implementation**

Understand the architecture of GANs and implement a basic GAN to generate images.

2. **Variational Autoencoder** 

 Learn about VAEs and build a model to generate new data points from learned representations. 

3. **Text Generation with GPT** 

Use GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models for text generation tasks. 

4. **Style Transfer** 

Implement neural style transfer to apply artistic styles to images. 

5. **Music Generation** 

 Generate music using generative models like WaveNet.

## Requirements
To get started with the projects, ensure you have the following prerequisites: -

1. **Latest Vesion of Python**

2. **Basic knowledge of TensorFlow, PyTorch and Pandas**

3. **Use of IDEâ€™s like Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm, etc**

4. **Basic understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
## Pull Request
Making a pull request on GitHub involves several steps, starting from cloning a repository,
making changes, and then submitting the pull request. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do
this with code for your contribution:
### 1. Fork the Repository
First, fork the repository you want to contribute to. This will create a copy of the repository in
your GitHub account.
### 2. Clone the Forked Repository

Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh

git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

cd repository-name

```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `repository-name` with the name of

the repository you forked.

### 3. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your changes. It's a good practice to name your branch based on the

feature or fix you are working on:

```sh

git checkout -b feature-branch-name

```

Replace `feature-branch-name` with a meaningful name for your branch.

### 4. Make Your Changes

Make the necessary changes to the codebase using your preferred code editor or IDE.

### 5. Stage and Commit Your Changes

After making your changes, stage the changes using:

```sh

git add .

```

Then commit your changes with a meaningful commit message:

```sh

git commit -m "Description of the changes"

```

### 6. Push Your Changes to GitHub

Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:
```sh

git push origin feature-branch-name

```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.

2. You should see a notification to compare & pull requests. Click on "Compare & pull request".

3. Ensure the base repository is the original repository you forked from, and the base branch is

the branch you want to merge into (usually `main` or `master`).

4. Ensure the head repository is your forked repository, and the compare branch is the branch

you just pushed.

5. Add a title and description for your pull request.

6. Click "Create pull request".

### That's it! You've successfully created a pull request on GitHub. The repository maintainers

will review your changes and merge them if everything looks good.

Please ensure your contributions adhere to our Code of Conduct.
